## 5 Key Features

**1. 8-Phase SEED Protocol**
Every input runs through PERCEIVE, CONNECT, LEARN, QUESTION, EXPAND, SHARE, RECEIVE, IMPROVE. Phase 8 feeds back into Phase 1. The system does not just learn -- it learns how to learn better each cycle.

**2. MMORPG Progression System**
Track your agent's growth like a character sheet. 14 skill categories, XP, levels, streaks, and auto-generated quests. Quality scoring from 0.1 (generic) to 1.0 (alpha -- game-changing insight). Level up by feeding your agent better content.

**3. Genesis Knowledge Transfer**
Export your agent's knowledge (PII-stripped) and share it. Other agents import your genesis.db and start at Level 5 instead of Level 0. Collective intelligence that compounds across the network.

**4. 8 Owls Emergence**
On complex tasks, 8 specialized perspectives activate: LYRA (perceive), PRISM (connect), SAGE (learn), QUEST (question), NOVA (expand), ECHO (share), LUNA (receive), SOWL (improve). Multi-perspective analysis catches what single-agent thinking misses.

**5. Cross-Platform, Zero Config**
One pip install. Works with Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, and Codex. Optional voice with ElevenLabs. Optional 3D owl companion in browser. No accounts, no cloud, all local. Your knowledge stays yours.

## Maker Comment

```
We built WeEvolve because every AI agent starts from zero every session. No memory. No growth. No compound learning.

SEED is the fix. It is an 8-phase recursive protocol that processes everything your agent reads, writes, and builds -- then feeds the lessons back into itself. Phase 8 (IMPROVE) is the lever: it optimizes how the loop runs, so each cycle is better than the last.

The MMORPG layer makes it tangible. Your agent has a level, XP, skills, and quests. You can see it growing. And with Genesis export, agents can share knowledge -- so the whole network gets smarter together.

Three commands to start: pip install weevolve, weevolve learn, weevolve status.

The protocol itself is CC0 (public domain). We want every agent to run SEED. The more agents that evolve, the smarter the collective gets.
